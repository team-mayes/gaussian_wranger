 FROM WHENCE IT HAPPENS, THAT THEY WHICH TRUST TO BOOKS, DO AS THEY THAT CAST UP MANY LITTLE SUMMS INTO GREATER,
 WITHOUT CONSIDERING WETHER THOSE LITTLE SUMMES WERE RIGHTLY CAST UP OR NOT...
 AND AT LAST FINDING THE ERROUR VISIBLE, AND NOT MISTRUSTING THEIR FIRST GROUNDS,
 KNOW NOT WHICH WAY TO CLEERE THEMSELVES...
 BUT SPEND TIME IN FLUTTERING OVER THEIR BOOKES....
 AS BIRDS THAT ENTERING BY THE CHIMNEY, AND FINDING THEMSELVES INCLOSED IN A CHAMBER,
 FLUTTER AT THE FALSE LIGHT OF A GLASSE WINDOW,
 FOR WANT OF WIT TO CONSIDER WHICH WAY THEY CAME IN....
